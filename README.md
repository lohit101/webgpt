# WebGPT

## Overview

WebGPT is a Python project that combines web scraping and natural language processing to create a chatbot that can interact with a website's data as if you are having a conversation with the website itself. This project leverages the power of web scraping to retrieve information from a target website and then uses a chatbot interface to provide a conversational way to interact with the scraped data.

With WebGPT, you can easily query information from the website, receive relevant responses, and even automate tasks that require interacting with the website. Whether you're looking to automate data retrieval, have a dynamic and user-friendly interface to interact with a website, or simply want to explore the capabilities of web scraping and chatbots, this project provides a solid foundation to get you started.

## Features

- 'Web Scraping': Utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from a target website.
- 'Natural Language Processing': Employs NLP capabilities to understand and respond to user queries.
- 'Interactive Chat Interface': Provides a chat-like interface for users to interact with the website's data.
- 'Customizable': Easily adaptable to different websites and chatbot configurations.
- 'Extendable': Open-source and easy to extend with additional features.
